## Overview

This repository is home to tooling related Dart packages. Generally, this means
packages published through the
[tools.dart.dev](https://pub.dev/publishers/tools.dart.dev) publisher that
don't naturally belong to other topic monorepos (like
[dart-lang/build](https://github.com/dart-lang/build),
[dart-lang/test](https://github.com/dart-lang/test), or
[dart-lang/shelf](https://github.com/dart-lang/shelf)).
