This package is intended to be used on Dash (Flutter, Dart, etc.) related tooling only.
It provides APIs to send events to Google Analytics using the Measurement Protocol.

## Usage

To get started using this package, import at the entrypoint dart file and
initialize with the required parameters

```dart
import 'dash_analytics';

// Constants that should be resolved by the client using package
final DashTool tool = DashTool.flutterTools; // Restricted to enum provided by package
final String measurementId = 'xxxxxxxxxxxx'; // To be provided to client
final String apiSecret = 'xxxxxxxxxxxx'; // To be provided to client

// Values that need to be provided by the client that may
// need to be calculated
final String branch = ...;
final String flutterVersion = ...;
final String dartVersion = ...;

// Initialize the [Analytics] class with the required parameters;
// preferably outside of the [main] method
final Analytics analytics = Analytics(
  tool: tool,
  measurementId: measurementId,
  apiSecret: apiSecret,
  branch: branch,
  flutterVersion: flutterVersion,
  dartVersion: dartVersion,
);

// Timing a process and sending the event
void main() {
    DateTime start = DateTime.now();
    int count = 0;

    // Example of long running process
    for (int i = 0; i < 2000; i++) {
        count += i;
    }
    
    // Calculate the metric to send
    final int runTime = DateTime.now().difference(start).inMilliseconds;

    // Generate the body for the event data
    final Map<String, int> eventData = {
      'time_ns': runTime,
    };

    // Choose one of the enum values for [DashEvent] which should
    // have all possible events; if not there, open an issue for the
    // team to add
    final DashEvent eventName = ...; // Select appropriate DashEvent enum value

    // Make a call to the [Analytics] api to send the data
    analytics.sendEvent(
      eventName: eventName,
      eventData: eventData,
    );

    // Close the client connection on exit
    analytics.close();
}
```

## Opting In and Out of Analytics Collection

It will be important for each Dash tool to expose a trivial method to
disabling or enabling analytics collection. Based on how the user interacts
with the tool, this can be done through the CLI, IDE, etc. The Dash tool will
then pass a boolean to an API exposed by the package as shown below

```dart
// Begin by initializing the class
final Analytics analytics = Analytics(...);

// The boolean below simulates the user deciding to opt-out
// of Analytics collection
final bool status = false;

// Call the method to pass the boolean
analytics.setTelemetry(status);
```

## Informing Users About Analytics Opt-In Status

When a user first uses any Dash tool with this package enabled, they
will be enrolled into Analytics collection. It will be the responsiblity
of the Dash tool using this package to display the proper Analytics messaging
and inform them on how to Opt-Out of Analytics collection if they wish. The
package will expose APIs that will make it easy to configure Opt-In status.

```dart
// Begin by initializing the class
final Analytics analytics = Analytics(...);

// This should be performed every time the Dash tool starts up
if (analytics.shouldShowMessage) {

  // How each Dash tool displays the message will be unique,
  // print statement used for trivial usage example
  print(analytics.toolsMessage);
}
```

## Checking User Opt-In Status

Some Dash tools may need to know if the user has opted in for Analytics
collection in order to enable additional functionality. The example below
shows how to check the status

```dart
// Begin by initializing the class
final Analytics analytics = Analytics(...);

// This getter will return a boolean showing the status;
// print statement used for trivial usage example
print('This user's status: ${analytics.telemetryEnabled}');  // true if opted-in
```

## Advanced Usage: Querying Locally Persisted Logs

This package enables dash tools to persist the events that have been
sent to Google Analytics for logging by default. This can be very helpful if
dash tools would like to understand the user's activity level across all
dash related tooling. For example, if querying the locally persisted logs
shows that the user has not been active for N number of days, a dash tool that
works within an IDE can prompt the user with a survey to understand why their
level of activity has dropped.

The snippet below shows how to invoke the query and a sample response

```dart
// Begin by initializing the class
final Analytics analytics = Analytics(...);

// Printing the query results returns json formatted
// string to view; data can also be accessed through
// [LogFileStats] getters
print(analytics.logFileStats());

// Prints out the below
// {
//     "startDateTime": "2023-02-08 15:07:10.293728",
//     "endDateTime": "2023-02-08 15:07:10.299678",
//     "sessionCount": 1,
//     "flutterChannelCount": 1,
//     "toolCount": 1
// }
```

Explanation of the each key above

- startDateTime: the earliest event that was sent
- endDateTime: the latest, most recent event that was sent
- sessionCount: count of sessions; sessions have a minimum time of 30 minutes
- flutterChannelCount: count of flutter channels (can be 0 if developer is a Dart dev only)
- toolCount: count of the dash tools sending analytics
