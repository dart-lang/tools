### Breaking Changes

* Removed dependency on `package_resolver` and changed the apis to accept a
  `Map<String, Uri>` which maps package names to the base uri to resolve the
  `package:` uris for those packages.
* The `sdkRoot` argument must be an `Uri`. Use `Uri.parse` for use
  cases previously passing a `String`.
* The deprecated `packageRoot` argument has been removed.

## 1.1.5

* Set max SDK version to `<3.0.0`.

## 1.1.4

* Support source maps that depend on the uri of the location to resolve spans
  correctly.

## 1.1.3

* Add a missing dependency on `path`.

## 1.1.2

* Fix a typo in the previous fix.

## 1.1.1

* Don't crash if the `SyncPackageResolver` has no package information at all.

## 1.1.0

* `mapStackTrace()` now uses a `SyncPackageResolver` object from the
  [`package_resolver` package][package_resolver] to recreate `package:` URIs.

* **Deprecation**: the `packageRoot` parameter to `mapStackTrace` is deprecated
  in favor of the `packageInfo` parameter described above. It will be removed in
  a future release.
