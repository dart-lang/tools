/// The purpose of this example file is to demonstrate the sampling
/// rate functionality from the survey handler.
///
/// It defines a [remoteUniqueId] that subs in for a real survey's unique
/// ID that is hosted in the remote json file.
///
/// Begin the simulation by setting the [testSampleRate] and [iterations]
/// variables, where [iterations] simulates real users and [testSampleRate]
/// represents a fraction of how many people should be sampled.
///
/// In this example, we have set the [testSampleRate] to `0.3`, meaning we want
/// sample 30% of users, and [iterations] to `10,000`, which simulates `10,000`
/// users.
///
/// Running the script with predefined seed of `123` will
/// generate the below `stdout`
/// ```
/// Test sample rate = 0.3
/// Number of iterations = 10000
/// ---
///
/// Count of iterations sampled (successes) = 3046
/// Actual sample rate = 0.3046
/// ---
///
/// Runtime = 8ms
/// ```
///
/// The actual results yielded 3,046 people selected for a rate
/// of `30.46%` which is about the `30%` defined in [testSampleRate].
