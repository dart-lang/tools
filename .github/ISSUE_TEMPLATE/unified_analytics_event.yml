        An event is an action that a user, or the tool, performs. 
        You can see the events that are being collected [here](../../pkgs/unified_analytics/lib/src/enums.dart)
        and the data associated with those events [here](../../pkgs/unified_analytics/lib/src/event.dart).

        You can request that a new event be added to the package 
        regardless of whether it's included in the privacy design documentation. 
        However, the privacy team will need to approve before it is added.

        If the event already exists, please tell us the name of the event 
        you would like to add data to.

        If this is a new event, tell us the name, description, and tool owner. 
        Possible tool owners can be found in the `DashTool` enum [here](../../pkgs/unified_analytics/lib/src/enums.dart).

        For example, pub_get represents pub package resolution details. The owner is the Dart tool.

        Event data are key-value pairs that are associated with an event.
        Please list the different event data associated with this event. 
        You should also include a description of the event data values.

        For example, if the event is pub_get, one event data may be 
        the packageName. The values would be the name of the package 
        as a string.
